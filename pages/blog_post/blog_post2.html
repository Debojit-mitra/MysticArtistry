                The Northeast culture of India is very vibrant and this is
                especially visible in the handicrafts, handlooms and food
                products. The culture that has been there for more than hundreds
                of years is being preserved by the current generation and the
                same is visible in the start-ups who are contributing to
                promoting the local product of this region across the country.
                Here is a list of three North-Eastern start-ups that are doing
                their best not only to protect this rich culture but to spread
                it across different states.

                <strong>Zizira-Shillong</strong>
              </h2>
              <p class="blog_paragraph_text">
                Based in Meghalaya, this start-up deals with honey, spices and
                herbs of the state. The company offers a pure but rare product
                that is based on their knowledge of local languages, cultures
                and drawing of the state. Products that are must-buy from this
                start-up includes ginger powder, turmeric, whole spices, raw
                honey, ground spices and other blends which are very famous.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="blog_paragraph_text">
                Ziria-Shillong has a loyal customer base and they are so loyal
                that they wait for the harvest time to get their product
                delivered. The brand is mostly used by clients who are
                health-conscious. Started by Ralph Budaleman in 2004, he
                understood the underutilized potential of the agricultural
                resources of the state and launched it. Initially, a group of
                individuals were trained hard for it as it focused highly on the
                ground knowledge.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="blog_paragraph_text">
                What makes the start-up different from other start-ups is the
                fact that it did not hire professionals but focused on
                recruiting people who are eager to build their skills and have
                the right values. The products of the company can be directly
                purchased either from Amazon or from their website. Once
                purchased, the product is delivered right at the doorstep with
                the help of amazing courier services like eKart and China Post.
                The company is expanding and it will soon start working on
                international deliveries too.

                <strong>Runway Nagaland</strong>
              </h2>
              <p class="blog_paragraph_text">
                This company was founded back in 2013 to promote the products
                made in Nagaland using local materials and techniques. Runway
                Nagaland â€“ Dimapur deals with handmade products and indigenous
                art and it works with an all-women artisan team to deliver the
                products. The startup was created with the motive to pass the
                old knowledge of handcraft to the future generation. By doing
                so, it not only aims to preserve the culture and tradition of
                Nagaland but also to improve the economy of the state by
                bringing in more business and address the issue of mass
                migration.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="blog_paragraph_text">
                Surprisingly, the customers of Runway Nagaland, not only belong
                from the state of Nagaland but outside it which shows that
                people prefer their handmade products.

              <br />
              <p class="blog_paragraph_text">
                While starting the business, Hengna, the founder faced many
                issues like lack of funding and capital and the stereotype of
                women working in the business but she smashed it all to grow the
                company.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="blog_paragraph_text">
                Even though the difficulties were present, the government of the
                state played an active role in supporting the different
                start-ups by helping the youngsters to get the right information
                in order to expand their ventures. Currently, Runway Nagaland is
                thinking of expanding by creating products made out of natural
                materials like banana fibre which will also improve the
                employment opportunities in the village.

                <strong>Brahmaputra Fables</strong>
              </h2>
              <p class="blog_paragraph_text">
                Brahmaputra Fables was founded in 2017 by Dhruba Jyoti Deka in
                Assam. It is an online marketplace that features handicraft,
                handloom and ethnic food products of the state. She got the idea
                of starting Brahmaputra Fables during her college days when her
                friends were in awe of the traditional products of the state.
                Jyoti Deka belongs to Sarthebari, a village that is popular for
                its bell and brass metalwork. He harnessed this talent by
                eliminating the middleman and supplying the product across the
                country while improving the livelihood of the artisans.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="blog_paragraph_text">
                Brahmaputra Fables features more than 3000 weavers and artisans
                in the region. The start-up is currently focusing on the
                residents of tier-1 cities along with corporate organizations.
                When many businesses were forced to shut down during the Covid
                lockdown, Brahmaputra Fables saw an increase in demand for its
                products as they are sustainable. The store currently features
                more than 100 products and all of them are eco-friendly which
                makes it an environment-friendly company. Soon, Brahmaputra
                Fables will be integrating tech-enabled touch to make the
                ordering process an extremely easy task.
