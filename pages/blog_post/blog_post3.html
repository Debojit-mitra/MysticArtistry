                Ngatok is distinguished by its cooking method, which involves
                the use of hot stones. The stones are heated before being
                inserted into the flesh. Ginger, garlic, local peppers,
                coriander, basil leaves, and chilies are common ingredients in
                the recipe. These spices are used to marinate the meat before it
                is cooked on heated stones.
